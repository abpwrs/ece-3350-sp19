Computer Architecture (ECE:3350) 
Project Part #1
Due: Feb 25th 2019
Team Members: Cooper Bell, Tina Liu, Alex Powers

Description:
We finished the implementation of ctrl.v as a finite state machine. 
We implemented the control for R-type instructions and the add immediate instruction.
sisc.v now connects all of the instantiated modules through control and data signals.
We ran the test bench and validate the results of both arithmetic instructions and status code generation.
